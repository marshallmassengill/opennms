/**
 * Thrown by {@link HttpUrlConnection} when a downstream HTTP call returns
 * 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden. Subclasses {@link IOException} so
 * callers that don't care about auth-specific handling can treat it like
 * any other I/O failure; callers that do (the XML collector's
 * dynamic-auth retry path) catch this type specifically and attempt to
 * invalidate-and-refresh the offending token.
 *
 * <p>The {@code attemptedHeaderValues} list, when populated, carries the
 * literal header values that were on the failed request. The controller-
 * side retry path uses these to invalidate matching cache entries when a
 * minion-served collection surfaces an auth failure across the RPC
 * boundary; the in-process retry path on the controller picks the same
 * values out of the live request directly.</p>
